# coupon_system_project_java
My first serious project using java.

This project is a full working back end coupon system.

implementing a full CRUD and some extra methods including business logic.

to use the system you may need to login to grant permission to one of three client types:

-admin (email:admin,password:admin)
-company (email:Updated,password:AdminTest)
-customer(email:updated,password:AdminTest)

enjoy!
