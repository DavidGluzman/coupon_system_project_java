# coupon_system_project_java
My first serious project using java.
This project is a full working back end coupon system,
which is using MySQL as a database language,
java as a programming language,
utilizing a full CRUD and some extra methods using
a login manager and facade to grant permissions to 3 sorts of clients:
-admin
-company
-customer

enjoy!
